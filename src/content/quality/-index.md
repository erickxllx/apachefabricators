  content: Safety is an integral and foundational component of our company culture.From our top-tier management to the skilled individuals who adeptly tackle customer concerns, all operations at Apache Fabricators  revolve around a steadfast dedication to safety. This includes the well-being of our workforce, our communities, and the environment. This commitment is evident in our continuous efforts to instill safety practices deeply into our corporate culture, shaping the way each team member approaches their daily tasks. At Apache Fabricators, our health, and safety culture is an ever-evolving and sustaining program based on the identification and control of workplace hazards through direct employee engagement, top management commitment, ongoing and persistent hazard analysis, and control, as well as the rewarding of positive safety behaviors. We use the SAFE way tool to help us identify those workplace hazards and controls prior to beginning a task by asking a series of questions like “What am I about to do?”, “How can it hurt me?” and “What am I going to do about it?”. We are currently focused on implementing our 20-20-20 safety exercise, which consists of taking 20 seconds every 20 minutes to check 20 feet around and identify any potential hazards, avoiding them and thus making our safety culture a priority. This is done with the support and commitment of each of our employees. We recognize that safety is a team effort involving commitment from top management, supervisors and employees. Our impeccable safety record shows every employee’s commitment to our safety program and to each other. At Apache Fabricators, we truly believe we are a family and we take care of each other.
